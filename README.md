# Documentation

The various Functions included are:

## Check Prime 
    
    This Function check prime number upto 10^7.

    Sieve of Eratosthenes is used.
    
    Returns a "boolean" result.
    
    USE: bool prime = check_Prime(variable);

## Check Large Prime number

    This function works on a large prime numbers.

    Use long long or long long int. 

    Returns a "boolean" result.

    USE: bool prime = check_LargePrime(variable);

## Factorial of a large number

    This function returns results in O(nlogn).

    Returns a "vector<int>" as the answer produce is large and cannot be stored in any data type.

    USE: vector<int> ans = factorialOfLargeNumber(variable);

## Nth Fibonacci Number

    This function returns results in O(n) and take O(1) constant space.

    Returns nth fibonacci in "long long int" type.

    USE: long long int fib = nthFibonacci(variables);

## Check Palindrome
    This function returns results in O(length of number).
    Convert the given integer into a string before passing.
    For that use "to_string()" function.

    Returns a "boolean" results.

    USE: bool palindrome = checkPalindrome(string num);
